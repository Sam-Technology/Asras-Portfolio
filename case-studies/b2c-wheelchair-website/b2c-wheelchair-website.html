        <ul>
          <li>
            There can be up to 200 measurements taken for a custom wheelchair,
            and a lot of 'eyeballing' involved. This results in inconsistencies
            secondary to input variability and error, ultimately leading to user
            uncertainty regarding custom fitting.
          </li>
          <li>Scripting process can be intrusive and awkward for the user.</li>
          <li>
            Wheelchair manufacture process is not interactive and the user often
            does not know what stage of development or when their wheelchair
            will be complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            User does not have instant feedback and have no way of knowing how
            the chair will feel and look like.
          </li>
          <li>Lack of centralised and digitised data collection process.</li>

          Wheelchair users feel uncertain during the scripting process and want
          better control and transparency over their entire journey, however
          current technology and the environment does not provide for it.

        <br />
        <b> To solve the problem, I need to understand the existing process!</b
        ><br /><br />

        With the above problem hypothesis and limited insights into the
        wheelchair industry, I kick off the discovery phase with these research
        objectives:
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            A better understanding of the current end-to-end process of
            procuring a custom wheelchair from the perspective of the wheelchair
            user, scripters (measurer) and business owners.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exploring user goals and pain points in the above experience and
            journey.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        The pandemic has greatly affected the way we interact, particularly
        in-store purchasing. With the various lockdowns and restricted access
        for users to view products and get in-person measurements, exploring and
        understanding the behaviours and preferences of online shoppers,
        particularly made-to-order products, was crucial.

            wheelchairs are costly in USA ($6k–12k), often requiring lengthly

        <h3>Understanding the user groups and roles</h3>

        As the research data was collated, I developed a timeline of the
        wheelchair procurement process to help uncover and map out user pain
        points throughout their purchasing journey. Three product and
        solution-focused personas were then established to reflect the target

        the original problem hypothesis was not the problem users were
        experiencing.
        <br /><br />
        I Realigned and redefined the problems to reach a more relevant

        <h3>Generating idea concepts</h3>
        <br />
        I did an ideation process to generate potential solutions to the above
        guiding questions and tackled the user pain points that I found on the
        overall research process. Then prioritized a few based on how much value
        they add to the user and feasibility (time and money).

        <h2>CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Brand</h3>
        The 'Wheely', a brand that speaks directly to the customer, is warm,
        inviting, and inspires exploration.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Accessibility – meeting level AA WCAG compliance</h3>

        Accessibility considerations plays a vital role in the design style
        guide and system. I achieved WCAG 2.0 Level AA conformance by ensuring
        the Wheely site is inclusive, usable and understandable for the majority
        of people with or without disabilities*.<br /><br />

          >here</a
        >

        <br /><br />
        <h3>Information architecture</h3>
        As I was developing multiple features within the website, it is crucial
        to map out how these features will integrate seamlessly and where the
        multiple access points are. An IA of the entire site was established to
        distinguish the hierarchy of information.

        <h2>USABILIY TEST</h2>
        <h3>Putting the design to the test with a selected user group</h3>
        <br />

        I conducted usability testing with 3 participants, including wheelchair
        users and occupational therapists. The goal is to ensure the design was
        clear, the flows easily followed, and to validate what I’ve created
        actually meets users' needs.
        <br /><br />
        The overall feedback were extremely positive which gave me confidence
        that the concepts I had created were hitting the mark. Changes were
        still apparent, but for the majority focused on terminology and content
        placement to ensure a seamless experience.

        <h2>LEARNINGS AND TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Understanding that the problem space is fluid and prone to change
            depending on the research.
          </li>

          <li>
            Research can be very handy and useful when they’re done correctly
            with proper thoughts.
          </li>

          <li>
            Thinking product constraints are as important as user constrains.
          </li>

          <li>3D features are really useful for the e-commerce industry.</li>

          <li>Some small features can have big effects on user engagement.</li>

          <li>
            Be comfortable with the 'unknown': understanding when to think far
            and wide without limitation and when to narrow down and focus.
          </li>

          <li>
            Don't focus too much on the details early on: it's difficult to show
            and test a product that does not look 'polish', but acknowledging
            that design is an iterative process that needs to be tested and
            validated.
