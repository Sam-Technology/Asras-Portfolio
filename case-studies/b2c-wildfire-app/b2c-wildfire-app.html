        What supplies do communities need during an emergency?

            Oregon.gov’s main focuses are on information about current wildfires
            and what to do following a wildfire. It provides resources to help
            after a wildfire and insurance information. The site also has
            information on ways to access food, hotels and pet boarding.
            Additional resources are a map of where wildfires are, an air
            quality map, and a road closure map. Oregon.gov does not have a way
            to sign up for alerts. The site does have a way to donate or

            <h3>Fire, Weather and Avalanche Center</h3>

            The Fire, Weather and Avalanche Center site’s main goal is to show
            communities where wildfires are currently. It uses a map to provide
            this information. The site does not provide any information about
            how to prevent, prepare, or evacuate from a wildfire. The site does
            not provide any guidance on what to do following a wildfire either.
            The Fire, Weather and Avalanche Center does not provide alerts or

            Calfire’s focus is on preventing and preparing communities for
            wildfires. It provides a list of important items to pack in the
            occurrence of a wildfire. The site also guides communities with
            steps to follow to help prevent wildfires. The site also provides
            guidance on what to do following a wildfire. There are three main
            keys: Plan, Know, and Act that the site utilizes to provide
            information. Calfire also has an app that provides alerts and
            additional information. The site utilizes social media and has many
            additional resources. However, it lacks a map to clearly show where
            any current wildfires are. The Calfire site does not offer a way to
            donate or volunteer.

        <h2>User Interviews & Surveys</h2>
        <p style="color: #7783ed">Key insights for evacuees</p>
        <b>Be Prepared</b> - Many evacuees wanted to plan for an evacuation, but
        didn’t know how and didn’t know what to take with them. They sometimes
        forgot important items.<br />
        <b>Be Informed</b> - The resources that evacuees found online only met a
        few of their needs. So they turned to social media, news media and their
        inner social network to get answers on how to prepare and where to
        go.<br />
        <b> Be Notified </b> - Evacuees signed up for emergency alerts were
        limited. The alerts weren’t frequent enough and/or didn’t provide safety
        information.<br /><br />

        <p style="color: #7783ed">Key Insights for Volunteers</p>
        <b>Volunteering</b> - People want to get involved, but don’t know how or
        understand the<br />
        volunteer positions, the skills required, and the time commitment.
        People that have volunteered in the past have found it to be a
        tremendously rewarding experience.<br />
        <b>Connections</b> - Evacuees have a range of needs that can be access
        to medical attention, resources, or FAQs. It’s important for Volunteers
        to identify these needs and connect the Evacuees to the appropriate
        resources.<br />
        <b>Sharing the Impact</b> - Volunteers are so busy while helping the
        community that they often lose sight of the impact they made. Hearing
        about the level of contribution inspires them to volunteer in the
        future.<br />
        <br />
        <p style="color: #7783ed">Key Insights for Community Organizers</p>
        <b>Manual Tracking</b> - Organizers track supplies using excel sheets or
        by hand. Due to the manual nature and the need for frequent updates the
        data may not be accurate. Situations within a wildfire can change
        rapidly. It is extremely important that supplies and donation funds are
        accurate and available at a moments notice for the organizer to
        distribute.<br />
        <b>Training</b> - Organizers recruit volunteers that do not have any
        experience or skills with emergency situations, and they don’t have the
        resources to train these individuals. Wildfires are dangerous even after
        they have run their course. It is important for organizers to provide
        resources to educate the community on common situations they might
        encounter.<br />
        <b>Communication</b> - Organizers communicate with various groups of
        Volunteers in different locations. Often times updates were not frequent
        enough to effectively help the community. It is imperative to understand
        the community’s needs in their time of crisis.<br />

          <b>Evacuee's Backstory:</b> Zack recently moved to USA. He lives with
          his partner and 2 pets. He hasn’t experienced a wildfire situation in
          US, but hears from his neighbors that wildfires often occur during the
          summers in US.
          <br />

              <img class="autofit-img" src="image 66.png" />
              <p>
                Zack hears from the tv news media that wildfires are starting to
                occur in his area. Zack is worried. So he texts his neighbors
                and they tell him about the “Sheltify” app and send a link.
              </p>

              <img class="autofit-img" src="image 69.png" />
              <p>
                While Zack is on the app, he checks out the county map to see
                the emergency status and is informed that his family is in the
                level 1 alert zone “Get Ready”. Zack talks to his partner and
                lets him know that they are in level 1 alert zone and they need
                to get ready. Together they look over the recommended wildfire
                preparation plan and evacuation packing list. That day, they
                pack some important items and take a few photos of their home.
                They feel ready and less stressed.

              <p>
                In the middle of night, Zack receives an alert on his phone from
                Sheltify that informs him they need to evacuate now! The app
                gives him a list of road closures to avoid.

                They grab their go bags and pets, pack the car, give each other
                a hug and head out of town.

              <p>
                While Zack’s partner is driving, Zack is researching where they
                can stay and realizes that many hotels are closed. Zack is
                starting to panic. He looks at the app and finds a community
                safe location on the app and hopes that this location has a
                place for them to stay.
              </p>

              <p>
                Using Sheltify, Zack verifies that there is room for him and his
                family and reserves a spot for him at the safe location. He
                sighs with relief. Zack, his partner and their 2 pets arrive at
                the community safe location.

          <b>Volunteer's Backstory:</b> Jennifer is a new volunteer with
          Sheltify. She was inspired to volunteer because two years ago she was
          saved from a fire from emergency volunteers. Today at 4pm she received
          the notification that there is fire and she needs to head to the
          evacuation site to help out.
          <br />

              <p>
                Jennifer receives the notification that there is a fire and her
                services are needed. Jennifer and her husband double check that
                all their previous preparations are in order before they head
                out.

                When they arrive, Jennifer checks in to the app and receives her
                first task. The new evacuees are beginning to arrive and she is
                posted at the entrance. It is her responsibility to greet them,
                instruct them on where to go and how to receive services they
                may need.

                She meets Zach who isn’t feeling well. She helps the couple to
                their assigned area and as they walk, she enters his request
                into the app to ensure that he is assigned to a medical
                volunteer to get him checked out.

                After about 3 hrs of helping Jennifer is feeling a bit
                overwhelmed. She bumps into Amelia and lets her know that she’s
                feeling a bit tired. Amelia has her check out of the app to
                collect herself, to get some rest and check on her own family.

          <b>Community Organizer's Backstory:</b> Amelia has been volunteering
          for decades and now is a community organizer for wildfire relief. She
          was notified that there is a wildfire in the area and starts preparing
          safe locations and delegates tasks to volunteers.​​​​​​​

                Volunteer Jennifer is near Amelia the Organizer and informs her
                that she is going on a break. Amelia hopes she is okay and is
                not getting over worked.

              <img class="autofit-img" src="image 83.png" />
              <p>
                Amelia the Organizer spreads the word on social media about the
                wildfire and the need for donations. Then, she starts using the
                messaging tool in the app to communicate with volunteers to make
                sure they take breaks as needed. She is worried about her
                volunteers just as much as the evacuees.
              </p>

              <p>
                As requests come in from evacuees, Amelia chooses a volunteer
                from the provided list of volunteers that can complete the
                request. (medical attention, items needed, etc.) and will repeat
                this process. She wants to make sure that more emergent requests
                are handled first.

              <p>
                As time goes on and people are able to go back home, Amelia has
                volunteers provide information to the evacuees on resources and
                steps to take when going home. Such as what to do once they are
                home, whether the home has no damage or a lot of damage. She
                feels this information is important for people to have so they
                know who to contact for help.

        <h2>USABILITY TESTING</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Evacuee Scenario / Test Script</h3>
        Step 1. Determine the proximity of the recent wildfire<br />
        Result: All users could tell where the fire was and the different danger
        zones on the interactive map.<br />
        <br />
        Step 2. Interactive Map<br />
        Result: About 30% of the test users didn’t realize the icons on the map
        were clickable.<br />
        <br />
        Step 3. Locate a recent news article about wildfires<br />
        Result: One test user thought the word “share” with a share icon on the
        main news page was to share the first news article. They didn’t realize
        they needed to either scroll down a little further to get a share button
        under each article card, or click to open the news article and then
        share from the article page.<br /><br />
        Step 4. Donate money or supplies<br />
        Result: All test users thought donations would be under the community
        tab, which is the location. Only one test user was unsure if donations
        were under the requests or community tab. They tried requests first, and
        then quickly realized that the requests tab was to make a request for
        assistance of some kind. Then, they went to the community tab and saw
        donations right away. All test users had no issues with the donation
        process and finished it very quickly.<br /><br />
        Step 5. Register to become a volunteer<br />
        Result: Overall all test users said they liked the app a lot. They felt
        all the features were important and easy to use.
        <br /><br />

        <h3>Community Organizer Scenario / Test Script</h3>
        Step 1. Find out which volunteers are in different groups from the
        interactive map. <br />Result: Test users were able to find the
        information on the interactive map right away.<br /><br />
        Step 2. Find out the financial balance of the incoming donations and the
        outgoing expenses<br />
        Result: All test users were able to find the financial information right
        away. They immediately realized this information was under the community
        tab.<br /><br />

        Step 3. Find out how many medical kits are on hand<br />
        Result: All test users found the information right away. They also
        figured out how to view what is on hand and what is needed or low / out
        of stock.<br /><br />
        Step 4. View all the volunteers that are available to help<br />
        Result: All test users were able to quickly see all on duty volunteers
        from the community page drawer without any issues.<br /><br />

        Step 5. Remove a volunteer from service<br />
        Result: All test users were able to complete this task. One user had
        technical issues, which caused their focus to be interrupted and
        required some redirection to get back on task. Once, back on track they
        completed the task quickly and easily.<br /><br />
        Step 6. Assign a volunteer to a request and assign a donated supply item
        to a request<br />
        Result: All test users were able to figure out how to start the process
        of assigning a task to a volunteer right away. Most test users, about
        80%, were able to complete the task quickly. A few test users lost their
        train of thought when they went to the step to add items from
        stock/supply. At that point I re-informed them of their task and asked
        them how they would go about doing that. Then, they realized right away
        they needed to click the “box” icon to start the process of adding items
        from stock.<br />
        All the test users then finished out this process quickly and easily.<br /><br />
        <h3>
          → Overall test users said the tasks were easy to complete. Numerous
          test users said they liked that the app guided them through all
          multi-step processes / tasks.

        <h3>Further Steps</h3>
        Revise prototype based on testing results<br />
        Second round of usability testing on improvements and additional
        features.
        <br /><br />
        Design additional features including:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>Interactive Map Time View</li>
          <li>Preparation & Evacuation Flow</li>
          <li>Return to Evacuated Home Flow</li>
          <li>Create a tablet Experience for the Organizer</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <br />
        Since, this is not a live app I do not have real data for our metrics.
        However, the user testing showed the app overall is intuitive and easy
        to use. All test users informed that they would use this app for any
        future wildfires in their area.
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b> Asking the right questions</b><br />
            This project has taught me the challenges and importance of having
            the right type of questions when setting up surveys. This increased
            limitations during the research due to lack of proper inclusion and
            exclusion criteria, not targeted at a specific group that eventually
            led to more variability in the result.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            Through research, I found the main issue for users was a lack of
            information on all things related to wildfires. Providing key
            information in a simplified was my main focus.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            User testing showed minor improvements that can be made to the
            original prototype to make the app an even better user experience.
